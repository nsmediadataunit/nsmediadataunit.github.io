  <h4 class="title">Systemic inequalities project</h4>

  <div class="foreground">
    <div class="scroll-section" id="step0"></div>
    <div class="scroll-section" id="step1">section 1 
      <p>The George Floyd protest brought attention to the systemic discrimination Black people still face in the US.</p>

      <p>The protests expanded globally, reaching London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle upon Tyne.</p>

      <p>Britain has its own issues. From birth to death, Black people in the UK are still at a disadvantage.</p> 
      </div>
    <div class="scroll-section" id="step2">section 2 
      <p>According to the 2011 census, Black people make up 3.3% of the population in England and Wales, up from just 1% in 2001. By contrast, white people make up 86% of the population.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scroll-section" id="step3">section 2' 
      <p>Despite that of the population, the Black population may still be continuing to grow. Just 71.3% of the children born in England and Wales in 2018 were white. Black children accounted for some 4.2% of births.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scroll-section" id="step4">section 3 
      <p>According to an MBRRACE-UK report, Black women in the UK have a higher chance of dying in pregnancy with 40 deaths for 100,000 women, five times the rate for white women.</p>

      <p>Despite representing 4.2% of the live births, Black infants also represented 7.6% of deaths in England and Wales in 2017.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="scroll-section" id="step5">section 4 
      <p>While children aged 4-5 of all backgrounds met expected development standards at similar rates, Black children generally receive worse grades as time goes on.</p>

      <p>39% of Black children received a strong pass (grade 5 or above) in English and maths compared to 50% of Asian children and 43% of white children.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scroll-section" id="step6">section 5 
      <p>Only 5.5% of Black pupils achieved three As or better at A level, compared to around 11% for white, Asian and mixed background pupils.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scroll-section" id="step7">section 6 
      <p>Perhaps due to Black Brits living in predominantly urban environments, Black pupils are increasingly more likely to go to university, with almost half (44.5%) entering one in 2019 compared to less than a third of white pupils (30.3%).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scroll-section" id="step8">section 7 
      <p>However, Black students generally receive worse grades. 57% of Black students graduated with first and upper second class honours compared to 77% of white students</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scroll-section" id="step9">section 8 
      <p>The divide continues on in the workforce. Being Black means you’ll earn £1 per hour less than an Asian or white worker, and the pay gap has been growing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scroll-section" id="step10">section 9 
      <p>Black employees are twice less likely to be directors, managers and senior officials compared to other groups, the same rate since 2004.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scroll-section" id="step11">section 10 
      <p>Black employees are twice less likely to be directors, managers and senior officials compared to other groups, the same rate since 2004.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scroll-section" id="step12">section 11 
      <p>Black people are also twice less likely to live in a house they own…</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scroll-section" id="step13">section 12 
      <p>… and almost three times as likely to live in social housing.</p>
